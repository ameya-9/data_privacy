# Accessing and Assesing the DSARs
Data Subject Access Request: Is a legal right under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which allows users to access their personal data that is being processed by organizations.

## Introduction 
Last year, in [Information Law and Policy](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/info/205) we discussed about Data Protection, the discussion related to definition of personal data and its protection, led me think of the personal data different consumer applications (social network applications) collect on us. This started a journey, involving lots of research about GDPR, CCPA, Indian Privacy Law which these commerical application have to bound to and how.
After thorough research and exploration. I raised request to access my personal data (often referred as DSARs) and analyzed the information gathered by different applications. Eventually, the research led to evaluation of this DSAR process and ways it could be improved.

Briefly the project could be divided into two parts : 
1. Data Subject Access Request - research, understanding, evaluating privacy policy (GDPR and CCPA), accessing my personal data.
2. Usability testing for DSARs and people's perception of privacy- Evaluating people's response and trust on different applications, conducting usability testings.

## Methodology:
1. Before implementing the project, I read few research paper to understand if there has been research done related to topic. Fortunately, the research was done in Europe (GDPR) and there was a longitudinal  study of companies. The paper "How do App Vendors Respond to Subject Access Requests? A Longitudinal Privacy Study on iOS and Android Apps" provided me with an approach towards the research and next steps.
2. Raising DSARs : I started to study what would be best approach to access data associated with my mobile applications accounts. I came across a research pape, [How do App Vendors Respond to Subject Access Requests? A Longitudinal Privacy Study on iOS and Android Apps ](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3407023.3407057) where the researcher did something similar on a span of 4 years between 2015 to 2019 ( before and after GDPR). The paper helped me to approach the independent research. I went through raising DSARs for 10 different applications, based on frquency o use and different categories.
